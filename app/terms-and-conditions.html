	Introduction

</div>

<ul class="decimal">
	<li>
TPG Technology Limited (Top Predictor, we, us, our) is a company registered in England with registration number 09770596 whose registered office is at 107 Cleethorpe Road, Grimsby, DN31 3ER, England, United Kingdom
</li>
	<li>This website is operated under license by Sunseven NV (#100554), E-Commerce park, Willemstad, Curacao under the license No. 8048/JAZ issued by Antillephone, authorised and regulated by the Government of Curacao. Management and compliance services are provided through GamblingTec.com which is a brand of Sunseven NV.</li>
	<li>We operate the Site. These Terms govern all access to and/or use of the Site. All references to the Site in these Terms shall apply equally to any “Top Predictor” mobile application as introduced by us from time to time.
</li>
	<li>In making use of the Site, you confirm that you have read and understood these Terms (including any documents expressly referred to herein) and you agree to be legally bound by them in relation to your use of the Site and your receipt of the Services. If you refuse to accept these Terms, you will be prohibited from opening an Account, entering any Competitions or make any further use of the Services.
</li>
	<li>Each time you use the Site, the Terms in force at that time will apply. As such, you should check these Terms (via the link on the Site) each time you make use of the Services.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">
	Entering Competitions

</div>

<ul class="decimal">
	<li>The Site provides Players with the opportunity to enter Competitions (determined by the outcome of sporting Matches) subject to these Terms.
</li>
	<li>In order to enter a Competition you will need to have sufficient funds in your Wallet to be able to pay the entry fee stated (except where the Competition is free-to-play). In making a decision whether to enter a Competition you should consider your financial status and all your financial commitments. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can afford to enter our Competitions. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, if so you are not authorised to use your payment card to complete transactions.
</li>
	<li>A gamecard showing the teams or individuals participating in each of the selected Matches (Gamecard) will be published on the Site for each Competition.
</li>
	<li>You are able to select a Competition and enter it by making the predictions on the relevant Gamecard and paying the stated entry fee, following the instructions set out on the Site.
</li>
	<li>In addition to these Terms, Competitions will usually also be subject to a particular set of Game Rules (relating to the relevant sport or series of Matches). These will be linked to on the Competition page and you should ensure you understand and accept these in full before entering the Competition.
</li>
	<li>In order to win a Competition, you must accumulate the most points in that Competition. Points are awarded to Players for correctly predicting Match outcomes. Points are accumulated through the course of each Competition to determine the leaders (while the Competition is live) and the winners (at the end of each Competition).
</li>
	<li>Match results will be as determined by the official sporting body for the relevant sport and/or Match (for example FIFA in respect of the FIFA World Cup). If no official result from a relevant sporting body is available, the result will be determined by Top Predictor using information from independent sources.
</li>
	<li>Top Predictor reserves the right to suspend settlement of any Competition for any reason, and to declare any Competition or match/leg therein null and void.
</li>
	<li>Top Predictor also reserves the right to resettle a Competition if it has been settled in error, be that human or technical. All Players will be liable for any 'negative' balances they may accrue as a result of a resettlement.
</li>
	<li>In the event that more than one Player (in a prize-winning position) has accumulated the same number of points at the end of a Competition, the relevant prize(s) will be split. The allocated prize money, and no more, will be split between the relevant Players. For example, if the three highest-scoring Players finish a Competition with the same number of points, the prizes allocated for 1st, 2nd and 3rd will be added together, and split evenly between those three Players.
</li>
	<li>Subject to all entry places being filled in respect of a Competition, we guarantee that the stated prizes will be available. In the event that all places are not filled, we reserve our right to reduce the stated prizes proportionately (to reflect the lower aggregate total of entry fees received) or to cancel the Competition entirely. We will only cancel the Competition in the event that there are not a sufficient number of Players to make running the Competition viable. In the event we do decide to withdraw the Competition, your entry fee will be refunded to you in full.
</li>
	<li>To ensure the Competition result is clear, predictions relating to a number of goals or points achieved in a Match will usually be expressed using a 0.5 goal/point margin (i.e. ‘over 2.5 goals’).
</li>
	<li>We may run several different Competitions in relation to the same Match.
</li>
	<li>You may only play a Joker (treble prize points) or an Ace (double prize points) once in any single Competition.
</li>
	<li>Any winnings due to you will be credited to your Wallet as soon as reasonably possible after the end of the relevant Competition (and in any event within 24 hours) save where there is a genuine and material dispute over the result of a relevant Match.
</li>
	<li>You are fully responsible for your predictions entered in respect of any Competition entry and we will not be liable for any losses suffered by you as a result of any errors, omissions or unintended predictions made by you.</li>
	<li>A Competition entry is not valid until it has been confirmed (on the Site) by us and your Competition entry shows up in your My Account part of the Site. This should happen immediately following receipt of your selection and entry fee but we do not accept any liability in respect of any Competition entries not confirmed and validated in accordance with this paragraph 3.17. In the event you have any questions about whether or not a Competition entry is valid, please contact us using the details set out at paragraph 19.
</li>
	<li>You may not amend a Competition entry after any Match (forming a part of your Competition entry predictions) has started or at any time thereafter. You may amend a Competition entry before this time.
</li>
	<li>You may not cancel a Competition entry at any time after it has been validated by us in accordance with paragraph 3.17.
</li>
	<li>In the event of any dispute over the time or details of a Competition entry, the information recorded on our Transaction Log will be deemed determinative whenever it is relevant.
</li>
</ul>

	Funding Your Wallet
</div>
<ul class="decimal">
	<li>Subject to compliance in full with these Terms, you can deposit funds into your Wallet and withdraw funds from your Wallet at any time in accordance with this paragraph 6.
</li>
	<li>All deposits into your Wallet must be made by debit card or via an associated payment provider. Full details of the cards which we accept and our associated payment providers can be found on the Site (as updated from time to time). We do not accept deposits from credit cards.
</li>
	<li>You are not permitted to have more than one debit card registered to your Account at any one time.</li>
	<li>There is a €5 minimum deposit. We do not allow daily deposits to be made in excess of €1,000. Any deposits above said maximum amount may be cancelled and returned by the Company. You may not hold deposited funds (i.e. not including winnings) totalling in excess of €1000 in your Wallet at any one time. In the event you attempt to exceed these limits, your transaction request may be rejected and any repeated attempts to exceed these limits may be deemed suspicious.
</li>
	<li>The Company has the right to request the Player to provide to the Company source of funds when the Player makes/has made a deposit of an amount greater than €2,000 (or local currency equivalent).
</li>
	<li>The maximum winnings amount per day/24 hours is €100,000 (or local currency equivalent), any winnings above said maximum amount may be cancelled by the Company.</li>
	<li>You accept that all transactions may be checked by us to prevent money laundering and that any transactions made by you which we deem suspicious, may be reported by us to the appropriate authorities.
</li>
	<li>The name on the debit card used to fund your Wallet must be exactly the same as the name on your Account.
</li>
	<li>Withdrawals must be made to the same card or payment method registered to your Account and you should allow up to 5 working days for the transaction to take place (this will depend on the destination account and transfer method used). We operate a ‘closed-loop’ policy whereby your net withdrawals must match or exceed your total deposits before you will be permitted to withdraw funds via a different method.
</li>
	<li>Transactions will show up on your bank (or payment provider) statement as “TPG Technology Limited”
</li>
	<li>All funds held in your Wallet are held in accordance with paragraph 16.
</li>
	<li>You undertake that:
</li>
	<li>Deposited funds rightfully belong to you and that these funds have not been obtained or are derived from any illegal means. The company retains the right to request additional source of funds based on a case-by-case basis.
</li>
	<li>All payments made into your wallet are authorised and you will not attempt to reverse any payment made into your wallet or take any action which will cause such payment to be reversed by a third party.
</li>
	<li>You will inform us immediately on becoming aware of any errors with respect to your Wallet and/or Account and, in particular, any deposits shown on your Wallet that you were not expecting. If such an error is as a result of a technical fault or human error we shall be permitted to correct the error once we have been made aware of such error, with no further liability to you.
</li>
	<li>We reserve the right to reverse or correct any payment to or from your Wallet in circumstances where we have debited or credited an incorrect amount from or to your Wallet if the result of a Match changes after a Competition has ended (as a result of a steward’s enquiry, for example). We will use our reasonable endeavours to inform you by email, without delay, in circumstances of our having made (or become entitled to make) such a corrective payment.
</li>
	<li>At no point during the period in which funds are held in your Account, will any interest accrued on such funds become due to you.
</li>
	<li>All funds which are deposited into your Wallet should be used, or you should have the intention to use such funds, for betting purposes. Your Wallet must not be used as a bank account. If we consider that you are using your Wallet as such, we reserve the right to terminate your Account with immediate effect and return all deposited funds to you.
</li>
	<li>Any Competition entry attempted by you when there are not sufficient funds in your Wallet (for any reason, including due to a declined deposit transaction) will be deemed invalid.
</li>
	<li>Funds may not be transferred directly from one Player’s Account to another Player’s Account.</li>
	<li>You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to account for any tax or duty imposed on you as a result of any of your wagers.</li>
	<li>For the avoidance of doubt, we do not offer credit.
</li>
	<li>All details relating to available Funds and winnings will be managed by us and, in the absence of manifest error, our decision in respect of such funds shall be final and deemed to be accurate.
</li>
	<li>All withdrawals must be done through the same payment method and details, chosen by the Player when placing a deposit, unless the Company is unable to do so or decides otherwise. This is at the discretion of the Company. If the Player has deposited using several payment methods, the Company reserves the right to split the Player’s withdrawal across such payment methods and process each part through the respective payment method at its discretion and in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulations.
</li>
	<li>Players agree that all deposits/withdrawals made to/from their Player account are transferred to/from bank account(s), debit cards, wallet or any other payment options available in the Player’s country, which belong solely to the Player and are in the Player’s name.
</li>
	<li>It is prohibited to make any withdrawal from a Player Account, bank account(s), debit card, wallet or any other payment options which do not belong solely to the Player. This is in order to prevent that the Company transfers funds to persons who have not been duly identified by the Company, in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulations.
</li>
	<li>Players may only withdraw the maximum amount of €1,000 (or local currency equivalent) in any twenty-four-hour period unless a larger amount has been agreed upon between the Player and the Company. The Company may reject a withdrawal request if the suspicion arises those funds are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons, pending the investigation thereto. Not withstanding the maximum withdrawal amount as defined in this article, the maximum withdrawal amount is limited by the limitations set by the payment method chosen by the Player when placing a deposit.
</li>
	<li>We recommend you retain copies of all transactions, merchant policies and rules.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">

</li>

This list of examples is not exhaustive and we reserve our right (acting reasonably) to deem any other action that we see fit to be a form of Bonus Abuse.</li>
	<li>We reserve the right to report all forms of Bonus Abuse and share such information with other third parties if we consider it necessary to do so.

We will take reasonable steps to prevent you from re-opening your Account or opening a new Account, and we have processes in place to detect duplicate Accounts that are subject to self-exclusion, but you must not attempt to circumvent such functions by trying to re-open your Account, by opening a new Account or by asking another person to open an Account for you. You agree that you will not attempt to open an Account or place any wagers whilst you are a self-excluded Player and that you are fully liable for your actions whilst you are a self-excluded Player. Upon detecting any such Accounts, we will return any deposits made by you and held in the Account (as at the date of your self-exclusion) within 14 days and delete the Account, in accordance with our responsible gambling policy.</li>

If the dispute is not wholly resolved after the abovementioned conversations, the Parties agree to enter into mediation in good faith to settle such a dispute and will do so before the Court of First Instance, Curacao.

	Other Important Terms

</div>

<ul class="decimal">
	<li>Seen the fact that an account is personal to that specific Player, whereby the Player has been identified, and that also the method of payments of any winnings is connected to the Player itself, in order to avoid possible money laundering, terrorist financing or other crimes, Player may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer or encumber in any matter whatsoever any of his/her rights or obligations under the Terms and Conditions.
</li>
	<li>In case the Player encumbers any of his/her rights or obligations under the Terms and Conditions, the Player shall forfeit all his/her rights under the Terms and Conditions towards the Company.
</li>
	<li>In case by law, or by a decision of a court the transfer of rights and/or obligations of the Player is deemed legal, all withdrawals shall be done through the same payment method and payment details chosen by the Player when placing a deposit, to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering policies and regulation.
</li>
	<li>We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.</li>
	<li>You may not assign these Terms to any third party.
</li>
	<li>This contract, created by you accepting these Terms, is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.
</li>
	<li>Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
</li>
	<li>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
</li>
	<li>In the case of any conflict between the English language version of the Terms and any versions in other languages, the English language version shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, reliance should not be placed on translations of the Terms produced by online translation services (such as Google Translate).
</li>
	<li>If any dispute arises in connection with these Terms (that falls outside the scope of the BCLB), you and we will attempt to settle it by mediation in accordance with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) Model Mediation Procedure. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR.
</li>
	<li>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. This means that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. You and we both agree to that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction.
